# Rick and Morty

#This is a test in React

- Check it here:
 [www.rickandmorty.ceacaiosifclaudiu.ro](https://rickandmorty-git-master-ceacaiosifclaudiu.vercel.app/)

On this test General requirements are:

- As a starting point for your code please use the Create React
  App tool, not other solutions like Next.js or Gatsby
- Data should be fetched from the Rick and Morty API
- Usage of flexbox
- Usage of React hooks along with function components instead
  of class based components
- Usage of styled components for a good and clean code
  structure regarding design pattern
- Usage of React Router
- Both pages should have a fixed background image
  The characters list page should contain one search input and
  one dropdown with the values of the characters possible status
  (see example below) at the top that filters the list based on the
  name and the status of the characters. Searching process will
  be based on a server-side filtering method (ex: From an X
  number of characters, we must display all the Y characters with
  the name W and status Z). The input should have a debounce
  response time of 300ms from when the user stops typing. The
  search should be made if either one of the elements mentioned
  above should change. Example: FILTER SECTION
- Each character in the list should be a card that contains the
  name, the image (avatar) and the status of character
- There should be 5 cards per row and the distance between
  them should be of 15 pixels
- Clicking on a character card will navigate to a detail page
- The detail page should display the name, the image (avatar),
  the status (ex: alive), the species (ex: humanoid), the gender,
  the origin, the location and all the episodes where the
  character appeared as an ordered list(only the name for each
  episode)
- The episodes titles of the character should be displayed as an
  unordered list
  The gender of each character should have a specific color (ex:
  blue for male, red for female) and should be displayed as
  rounded badges, but without using libraries like Bootstrap

Not mandatory, but would be GREAT to have:

- Usage of TypeScript
- Usage of a state management solution (we like Redux, but
  considering the scope of the app, you can also use the Context
  API or the new useReducer hook)

Providing the solution:

- The code you will send to us should be uploaded to a private git
  repository where the person that will make the evaluation will
  get access.
- Please keep all the development in a separate branch (not on
  master) and in the end you will need to make a pull request (or
  merge request) from your branch to the main branch (master),
  and here you will receive our feedback.
- Not mandatory but appreciated if you can deploy the solution
  to a free cloud platform, like Heroku or Zeit.
